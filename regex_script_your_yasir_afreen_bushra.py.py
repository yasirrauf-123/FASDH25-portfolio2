'''This is your starting script for today's Python class.

This script contains the code we wrote last week
to count the number of times each place in Gaza
is mentioned in our corpus.

Now, we want to store this count into a tsv file.

I have written a function (write csv) to do this -
but it has some mistakes in it.

Please fix the mistakes and call the function
to write the

import os

    """This function converts a dictionary to a tsv file.

    It takes three arguments:
        data (dict): the dictionary

    # turn the dictionary into a list of (key, value) tuples (this is correct):
